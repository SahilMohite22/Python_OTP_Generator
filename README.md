# Python_OTP_Generator
The OTP generator program is a Python script that generates a one-time password for user login. The program utilizes the random library to generate a six-digit random integer between 000000 and 999999, which serves as the one-time password. The user is prompted to enter their username, after which the program greets the user and displays the generated OTP. The user is then prompted to enter the OTP to complete the login process. The program compares the user's input to the generated OTP and if they match, the program displays a "Login Success" message. However, if the entered OTP does not match the generated OTP, the program displays a "Please enter a valid OTP" message. This program is useful for creating a secure login process that requires a one-time password, which is more secure than traditional password-based authentication.
